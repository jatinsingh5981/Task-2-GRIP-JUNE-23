# Task 2 - Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project focuses on performing unsupervised machine learning to make predictions. It includes the use of Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda Navigator for development.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Anaconda Navigator installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Download and install Anaconda Navigator from the official website (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.
3. Open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook.
4. Navigate to the project directory and open the `Task_2_Prediction_using_Unsupervised_ML.ipynb` file.

## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook file `Task_2_Prediction_using_Unsupervised_ML.ipynb` contains the code and instructions for the unsupervised machine learning prediction task. It provides step-by-step guidance on loading the data, preprocessing, applying unsupervised algorithms, and making predictions.

To run the notebook, execute each cell sequentially and observe the output and visualizations. Modify the code as needed to experiment with different techniques or datasets.
